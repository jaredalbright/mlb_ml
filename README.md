# MLB ML
This repo will be a collection of notebooks and small projects that I am using to teach myself ML centered around the MLB. The ```war_predictor``` is based on a tutorial from Dataquest and the ```next_game_predictor``` was my attempt to take what I have learned and venture away from the tutorials.

The data is all sourced from ```pybaseball```.

The best accuracy I was able to achieve thus far with the next game predictor is ```55.54%``` which can be benchmarked against SVM with sequential minimal optimization which is at ```58.9%``` and is one of the best predictors to date using ML.
